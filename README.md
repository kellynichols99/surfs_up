<h3> Summary Statistics for June</h3>
<p>First we retrieve all the temperatures for the month of June, then converted the temperatures  to a list and create a DataFrame from that list and generate summary statistics. We found the following:  </p>

-Mean Temerature = 74.944118

-Min Temerature = 64.000000

-Max Temperature = 85.000000
 
<h3>Summary Statistics for December</h3>

<p>Second we retrieve all the temperatures for the month of December, then converted the temperatures  to a list and create a DataFrame from that list and generate summary statistics. We found the following: </p>
  
-Mean Temerature = 71.041529

-Min Temerature = 56.000000

-Max Temperature = 83.000000

<h1>Challange Summary</h1>
With the review we have completed we can see that the temeratures for the months a June and December are fairly close and offer our client consistancy in weather. This is a good sign for the client and their proposed buisiness venture, as it allowes for customers to visit and participate in surfing year round.
